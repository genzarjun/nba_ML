Welcome to this project!

This program will allow the user to:

The user will choose a certain NBA stat -for example - Assists, and the program will graph the relationship between heights of active NBA players, and their assists (or whatever chosen stat), per game, in the regular season. 

From there, the program will use machine learning to apply weights to each of the heights, depending on how many values are there for each height, and then predict the most optimal height for making the most assists (or whatever chosen stat).

When writing the code, you will need to do a few installations on your code editor, depending on which code editor you are using, it may be different--but on most code editors pip will work.
```
pip install nba_api
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install statsmodels
```
